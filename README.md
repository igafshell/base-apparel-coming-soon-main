## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla HTML & CSS
- A bit of Vanilla JS and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first mobile-first project, so I learned how to implement responsiveness the other way around. Also, I learned about gradients in CSS and went a bit more in depth with handling form submits and events.

### Continued development

I'll continue to code and improve my frontend skills
